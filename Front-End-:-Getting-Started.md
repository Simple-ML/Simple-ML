Getting started:
Clone the project
```
git clone https://github.com/Anzumana/SimpleMLFrontend/
```

Download the latest LTS Release von [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) currently 14.15.4
Navigate inside the project folder and run.
```
npm install
```
This will download all the required dependencies so you can simply start the project
If everything worked so far you should now just need to run
```
npm run start
```
This will start the frontend of the gui

Alternatively if you want to take a look a the components that are available run
```
npm run storybook
```
A deployed version can be found [here](https://www.chromatic.com/library?appId=5fcf223aaf074f00212d726e)


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

For an overview of the application architecture itself we use [redux](https://redux.js.org/tutorials/essentials/part-1-overview-concepts)

If you want to learn redux a good place to start would be this [course](https://egghead.io/courses/getting-started-with-redux) created by
one of the main authors of redux.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
