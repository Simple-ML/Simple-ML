The workflow language is the part of the Simple-ML DSL that is designed to solve specific machine learning problems. It has the following concepts:

* [Workflows](./Workflow-Language-Workflows)
* [Workflow Steps](./Workflow-Language-Workflow-Steps)
* [Statements](./Workflow-Language-Statements)
* [Expressions](./Workflow-Language-Expressions)

Files that use the workflow language must have a name that ends with `.simpleml`.
