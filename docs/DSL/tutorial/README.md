The Simple-ML DSL is split into two main parts: The _[workflow language](./Workflow-Language.md)_ is used to solve specific machine learning problems. The _[stub language](./Stub-Language.md)_ is used to integrate code written in an external (general-purpose) programming language such a Python into Simple-ML so it can be used in the workflow language. Finally, both parts of the language use [packages and imports](./Packages-and-Imports.md) to avoid conflicts that could arise if two concepts have the same name.

**TODO:** Explain the two types of Simple-ML files
