The stub language is the part of the Simple-ML DSL that is used to integrate functions written in an external (general-purpose) programming language, such as Python, into Simple-ML. The stub language describes what is available and how it must be used. It has the following concepts:

* [Classes](./Stub-Language-Classes.md)
* [Enumerations](./Stub-Language-Enumerations.md)
* [Global Functions](./Stub-Language-Global-Functions.md)

Files that use the stub language must have a name that ends with `.stub.simpleml`.
